.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ./hsh ...

.SH DESCRIPTION
HSH is a simple shell command interpreter that prompts the user for instructions, then gets the command read from STDIN and executes it. It relies on the value of the PATH environment variable, in order to be able to find a command without the need to specify its absolute path, using the \fIstat\fR system call. If the command is found, \fIfork\fR is called to create a new process that will execute the command using the \fIexecve\fR system call. It also supports some built-in commands.

.SS Built-In Commands
Specific commands that can be used within the shell. Each built-in command can be invoked by using its name, eventually followed by one or more argument(s) if required. The supported built-in commands and their meaning are the following:
.RS
.LP
\fBexit\fR [\fISTATUS\fR]
.IP
Exits the shell with code \fISTATUS\fR if specified, or with code (0) otherwise.
.LP
\fBenv, printenv\fR
.IP
Prints all environment variables to STDOUT, one per line.
.LP
\fBsetenv\fR \fIVARIABLE\fR \fIVALUE\fR
.IP
Adds \fIVARIABLE\fR to the environment and initializes it to \fIVALUE\fR. If \fIVARIABLE\fR already exists, its current value is updated to \fIVALUE\fR.
.LP
\fBunsetenv\fR \fIVARIABLE\fR
.IP
Removes \fIVARIABLE\fR from the environment if it exists.
.LP
\fBcd\fR [\fIDIRECTORY\fR]
.IP
Changes current directory to \fIDIRECTORY\fR if specified, or to the HOME directory otherwise. This command uses the \fIgetcwd\fR and the \fIchdir\fR system calls to operate the change of current directory. The PWD environment variable will be updated accordingly.
.LP
\fBhelp\fR [\fIBUILT-IN\fR]
.IP
Prints the help to STDOUT for the command \fIBUILT-IN\fR if specified, or for all built-in commands otherwise.
.RE

.SS Path Search
When locating a command, HSH will first try to find a built-in command that matches the name it is looking for. If none is found but the name of the command starts with a slash or a period, it will simply try to execute the command as such. Otherwise, it will try to find the command in each directory entry contained in the PATH environment variable.

.SH EXIT STATUS
If terminated manually on regular execution, the shell will exit with the status code (0).
If the specified command does not exist or if it is not found, the shell will exit with the status code (127) and print an error message to STDERR.
If an error occured when creating a process to execute the specified command, the shell will exit with the status code (-1) and print an error message to STDERR.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
HSH needs some of the environment variables in order to work properly, and can change some of them. Built-in commands \fBsetenv\fR and \fBunsetenv\fR should not be used to change or remove them. Those variables are the following:
.RS
.IP \fBHOME\fR
This variable is used by the \fBcd\fR built-in command as default \fIDIRECTORY\fR if none is provided.
.IP \fBPATH\fR
This variable is used by HSH to search for an executable.
.IP \fBPWD\fR
This variable is updated by the \fBcd\fR built-in command everytime it is used, to keep track of the current working directory.
