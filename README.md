# üöÄ Creation of a Custom `SHELL`

Welcome to our custom `SHELL` project!

In this project, our goal was to write a simple UNIX command interpreter. We worked as a team to develop a simplified version of a shell, handling different commands and built-in commands.

## üìã Project Overview

This custom `SHELL` interprets the command inputs by the user. It can handle the basic commands such as `ls`, `pwd`, `touch`, `rm` and `man` as examples, as well as buit-in ones like `cd`, `env`, `exit` and `help`.

## üõ† Features

This custom `SHELL` supports the principals following features:

- Displaying files of a directory (`ls`).
- Displaying path of the current directory (`pwd`).
- Create a new file (`touch`).
- Remove a file (`rm`).
- Print the manuel of a command (`man`).
- Change the directory (`cd`).
- Print the current environnement (`env`).
- Exit the `SHELL` (`exit`).
- Print the help page of a built-in command (`help`).

## üìÇ Project Structure

The project contains several files, which are the following:

| Files | Description  |
| :-------- | :------- |
| [`main.h`](https://github.com/gwendalminguy/holbertonschool-simple_shell/blob/main/main.h) | The header file containing structures and functions prototypes. |
| [`paths.c`](https://github.com/gwendalminguy/holbertonschool-simple_shell/blob/main/paths.c) | The file containing functions related to the path search. |
| [`commands.c`](https://github.com/gwendalminguy/holbertonschool-simple_shell/blob/main/commands.c) | The file containing functions related to the command execution.  |
| [`environment.c`](https://github.com/gwendalminguy/holbertonschool-simple_shell/blob/main/environment.c) | The  file  containing functions related to environment variables. |
| [`builtin.c`](https://github.com/gwendalminguy/holbertonschool-simple_shell/blob/main/builtin.c) | The  file  containing functions related to built-in commands. |
| [`hsh.c`](https://github.com/gwendalminguy/holbertonschool-simple_shell/blob/main/hsh.c) | The file containing the main function of the program. |

## ‚öôÔ∏è  Compilation and Restrictions

**The code should be compiled this way:**

`gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh`

üí° What does it do?

This command is used to strictly compile all C files in our project.
It helps ensure the code is:

‚úÖ Clean and free from common bugs

‚úÖ Following C89 coding standards

‚úÖ Compiled with any warning treated as an error

**The restrictions are as follows**:

- No more than **5 functions** per file
- No use of global variables

Authorized functions and macros:

 - all functions from string.h
 - `access`
 - `chdir`
 - `close`
 - `closedir`
 - `execve`
 - `exit`
 - `_exit`
 - `fflush`
 - `fork`
 - `free`
 - `getcwd`
 - `getline`
 - `getpid`
 - `isatty`
 - `kill`
 - `malloc`
 - `open`
 - `opendir`
 - `perror`
 - `printf`
 - `fprintf`
 - `vfprintf`
 - `sprintf`
 - `putchar`
 - `read`
 - `readdir`
 - `signal`
 - `stat` (__xstat)
 - `lstat` (__lxstat)
 - `fstat` (__fxstat)
 - `strtok`
 - `wait`
 - `waitpid`
 - `wait3`
 - `wait4`
 - `write`

## üß© Use in Code

Let's take a look at what our `SHELL` actually does when we test our code with a `touch`, a `ls` and an `rm`:

```

hsh$ touch test
hsh$ ls
AUTHORS  README.md  builtin.c  commands.c  environment.c  hsh  hsh.c  main.h  man_1_simple_shell  paths.c  test
hsh$ rm test
hsh$ ls
AUTHORS  README.md  builtin.c  commands.c  environment.c  hsh  hsh.c  main.h  man_1_simple_shell  paths.c
hsh$ pwd
/home/dougdoug/holbertonschool-simple_shell

```

Let's take a look at what our `SHELL` actually does when we test our code with a `cd` and an `exit`:

```

dougdoug@dorinette:~/holbertonschool-simple_shell$ ./hsh
hsh$ ls
AUTHORS  README.md  builtin.c  commands.c  environment.c  hsh  hsh.c  main.h  man_1_simple_shell  paths.c
hsh$ cd ..
hsh$ ls
Betty                                    holbertonschool-printf        holbertonschool-simple_shell-1
holbertonschool-binary_trees             holbertonschool-shell         holbertonschool-sorting_algorithms
holbertonschool-low_level_programming-3  holbertonschool-simple_shell  snap
hsh$ cd holbertonschool-simple_shell
hsh$ ls
AUTHORS  README.md  builtin.c  commands.c  environment.c  hsh  hsh.c  main.h  man_1_simple_shell  paths.c
hsh$ exit
dougdoug@dorinette:~/holbertonschool-simple_shell$

```

Let's take a look at what our `SHELL` actually does when we test our code with a `unsetenv` and an `env`:

```

## üíæ Use of Memory

The code does not contain any dynamic allocation of the memory.
However, to ensure the code is free of any memory-related issue, a tool such as `Valgrind` can be used on the executable file, after compilation:

```
valgrind ./hsh 
==92313== Memcheck, a memory error detector
==92313== Copyright (C) 2002-2022, and GNU GPL'd, by Julian Seward et al.
==92313== Using Valgrind-3.22.0 and LibVEX; rerun with -h for copyright info
==92313== Command: ./hsh
==92313== 
hsh$ ls
AUTHORS  README.md  builtin.c  commands.c  environment.c  hsh  hsh.c  main.h  man_1_simple_shell  paths.c
hsh$ cd
hsh$ pwd
/home/dougdoug
hsh$ cd -
hsh$ ==92313== 
==92313== HEAP SUMMARY:
==92313==     in use at exit: 0 bytes in 0 blocks

==92313== 
==92313== For lists of detected and suppressed errors, rerun with: -s
==92313== ERROR SUMMARY: 0 errors from 0 contexts (suppressed: 0 from 0)
```
